<h1>About Us</h1>
<p>This Store is specialy for women.We would like to produce new clothes,specialy islamic clothes.We would like to invite you in our campany.There are 100 persons work and all of them are women.We build this website for women that they could buy very easly every clothe they want.The women can get every clothe just with a call.Also our prices are very appropriate.I build this website becaus i would like to have my own business.It is clear that in our country Afghanistan the women can not do business very easy.But the women try alot to be successful in their live and do their work by them self.Nowaday,the Afghan women work in different majors,specaily in the business.I hope that i could do something for the Afghan women and always be with them. </p>
